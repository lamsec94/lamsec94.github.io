## 1. Executive Summary

Project Overview: Deployed a Raspberry Pi-based SOC lab using Docker Compose for threat detection (Suricata/Zeek/ntopng), log aggregation (Promtail/Loki), and visualization (Grafana). Simulated attacks via DVWA to generate and analyze traffic, demonstrating end-to-end security monitoring.

Skills Showcased:  
- Containerization (Docker Compose configuration, volume mounting).  
- Network Security (IDS/IPS setup, alert generation).  
- Log Management (Scraping, storage, querying).  
- Visualization (Grafana dashboards with Loki integration).  
- Troubleshooting (Port exposure, config edits).  

Key Achievements: Processed 97k+ packets with zero drops, generated 6k+ alerts, and visualized real-time data across tools. This project validates efficient SOC operations on constrained hardware.

## 2. Introduction & Objectives

This lab was designed to deploy a fully-functional Security Operations Center (SOC) environment on resource-constrained hardware (Raspberry Pi 5). The goal was to develop expertise in threat detection using IDS/IPS tools, log aggregation and querying using Promtail and Loki, and visualization using Grafana dashboards. Additional tools like Zeek and ntopng expanded network analysis capabilities. The included vulnerable web app (DVWA) simulated attack traffic to validate detection capabilities.

Objectives:  
- Simulate real-world SOC workflows, from traffic ingestion to alert visualization.  
- Practice ethical hacking and response (e.g., SQL Injection exploits triggering logs).  
- Build skills in Docker for scalable, portable security setups.  
- Address hardware limitations (e.g., ARM architecture on Pi) to demonstrate optimization.  

This project relates to career goals in cybersecurity analysis, where tools like these are used for incident response and monitoring. It was self-initiated to apply concepts from certifications like CompTIA Security+ and prepare for roles in SOC operations.

## 3. Tools & Technologies Summary

- Suricata v7.0.11: Intrusion Detection System (IDS) for real-time packet inspection and alerting.  
- Zeek v7.1.1: Network security monitoring for protocol analysis and log generation.  
- ntopng v6.5: Real-time network traffic analysis with flow visualization.  
- Promtail v2.9.8: Log collection agent scraping and forwarding to Loki.  
- Loki v2.9.8: Log aggregation backend for efficient querying.  
- Grafana v12.2.0: Data visualization platform with custom dashboards.  
- DVWA (latest): Vulnerable web app for attack simulation.  
- Docker & Docker Compose: Container orchestration for deployment.  
- Other: EveBox for alert viewing, Redis for caching, Portainer for management.  

These were chosen for their open-source nature, compatibility with Pi 5 (arm64), and integration potential in a SOC stack.

## 4. Project Architecture Diagram

Visual Summary: Flowchart showing traffic/log/alert paths: Network Traffic → Detection (Suricata/Zeek/ntopng) → Log Processing (Promtail → Loki/EveBox) → Visualization (Grafana:3002).  

What Was Conducted: Created diagram using a tool like Draw.io, mapping components based on docker-compose.yml. Included ports (e.g., ntopng:3001, Grafana:3002) and flows (e.g., alerts to eve.json).  

Technical Insights: Bidirectional flows: Traffic ingestion via eth0, logs via volumes (/var/log/suricata, /home/pi/zeek-logs). Internal comms: Promtail pushes to loki:3100.  

Significance: Visualizes system integration, aiding in understanding complex SOC workflows.

## 5. Detailed Methodology & Setup

Step-by-Step Deployment:  
- Installed Docker and Docker Compose on Raspberry Pi 5 via `sudo apt update && sudo apt install docker.io docker-compose`.  
- Created project directory: `mkdir ~/cybersec-lab && cd ~/cybersec-lab`.  
- Defined docker-compose.yml with services (e.g., images, volumes for logs, ports like 3002:3000 for Grafana, 3001:3000 for ntopng).  
- Pulled images: `docker-compose pull`.  
- Deployed: `docker-compose up -d`.  
- Configured Promtail YAML for scraping (e.g., /var/log/suricata/eve.json, /home/pi/zeek-logs/*.log) and pushing to Loki.  
- Set up DVWA: Accessed UI, reset DB, set security to Low.  
- Generated initial traffic (e.g., pings, DVWA navigation) for testing.  

Key Configuration Snippet (Sanitized docker-compose.yml Excerpt):  

services:
suricata:
image: jasonish/suricata:latest
volumes:
- /var/log/suricata:/var/log/suricata:ro
promtail:
image: grafana/promtail:2.9.8
volumes:
- /var/log/suricata:/var/log/suricata
command: -config.file=/etc/promtail/promtail.yaml
grafana:
image: grafana/grafana:latest
ports:
- 3002:3000


Verification Commands:  
- `docker-compose ps` (check statuses).  
- `docker stats` (monitor resources).  

This setup ensured persistence and scalability.

## 6. Troubleshooting & Challenges

Challenge 1: Loki Connectivity:  
- Issue: Initial "Unable to connect" error due to unexposed port.  
- Resolution: Added ports: - "3100:3100" to Loki service in docker-compose.yml; redeployed with `docker-compose up -d`. Before: Connection refused logs; After: Successful `curl http://localhost:3100/ready` returning "ready".  

Challenge 2: Promtail Log Scraping:  
- Issue: No Suricata/Zeek logs in Loki (e.g., empty queries in Grafana).  
- Resolution: Edited Promtail YAML to add scrape_configs for paths like /var/log/suricata/eve.json; restarted container. Before: Empty {job="suricata"}; After: Populated logs with alerts.  

Challenge 3: ntopng Access:  
- Issue: No web UI due to missing port mapping.  
- Resolution: Added ports: - "3001:3000"; accessed at http://100.109.242.46:3001/.  

Lessons: Emphasized the importance of internal Docker networking and persistent volumes. These fixes improved reliability, reducing downtime to zero.

What Was Conducted: Generated traffic (e.g., UDP/STUN via DVWA or network activity). Ran tail command to capture real-time alerts. Analyzed for patterns (e.g., repeated STUN events).  
Technical Insights: Alerts: Misc activity, severity 3, metadata (high confidence, informational). Stats: Decoder events (e.g., IPv6 zero_len_padn:913), no invalids/drops. Flows: Timeouts, new/established states. (Added: Analyzed 6k+ alerts, identifying patterns like repeated STUN from 10.0.0.17.)  
Significance: Proves IDS is detecting threats (e.g., STUN for NAT traversal, potential VoIP risks). Generates data for downstream logging/visualization.

Visual Summary: `ls -la /home/pi/zeek-logs/` showing files (e.g., conn.log 924KB, dns.log 1.5MB) with permissions/timestamps, plus head -5 samples (structured with #separator \x09, paths like conn/dns).  
What Was Conducted: Ran ls and head commands to verify log generation. Ensured volume mounts in docker-compose.yml for persistence.  
Technical Insights: Files: Cover connections (conn.log), DNS (dns.log), HTTP, SSL, etc. Sizes/Timestamps: Indicate active logging (e.g., 1.5MB DNS from 2025-08-15 17:36). Structure: Tab-separated, with fields for easy parsing. (Added: 1.5MB DNS logs enabled anomaly detection, e.g., unusual queries.)  
Significance: Enables network forensics (e.g., DNS queries for anomaly detection). Complements Suricata for behavioral analysis.

## 8. Exploit Testing (DVWA SQL Injection)

**Step-by-Step Demo**:  
- Accessed DVWA at http://100.109.242.46:8080/, logged in as admin.  
- Set security to Low; navigated to SQL Injection module.  
- Entered payload ' OR '1'='1---dumped all users.  
- Advanced payload 1' UNION SELECT user, password FROM users#---revealed hashes (e.g., admin:5f4dcc3b...).  
- Generated 5+ requests, capturing in logs (e.g., Suricata alerted on anomalous HTTP).  
Results: Triggered Zeek HTTP logs and Suricata alerts, visible in Grafana as spikes in {job="suricata"}.

## 9. Results & Analysis

Key Metrics:  
- Packets: 97,422 processed with zero drops (Suricata stats).  
- Alerts: 6k+ (e.g., STUN ID 2016149---potential reconnaissance).  
- Logs: 1.5MB DNS (Zeek), 924KB connections---indicating robust capture.  
- Traffic: 7.7 Kbps throughput (ntopng), 99.4% from host IP.  
Analysis: STUN alerts suggest NAT traversal attempts, complemented by Zeek's UDP flows (e.g., from 10.0.0.17). Zero drops confirm reliable detection. SQLi exploit generated HTTP POSTs, analyzed as high-risk in dashboards---validating lab's efficacy for threat hunting.

## 10. Conclusion & Lessons Learned

This lab successfully created a functional SOC on Raspberry Pi, processing real traffic with high efficiency. Achievements include integrated monitoring across 11 containers and simulated attack detection.  
Lessons Learned: Mastered Docker networking (e.g., internal vs. external ports) and log persistence. Challenges like scraping issues taught config debugging.  
Next Steps: Add email alerting in Grafana, scale to cloud (e.g., AWS), or integrate ML for anomaly detection.
