# Security Operations Center (SOC) Analyst Project

## üìã Project Overview
This project demonstrates my practical skills as a SOC Analyst, including monitoring, analyzing, and responding to security incidents using industry-standard tools and methodologies. The project showcases end-to-end security operations capabilities from threat detection through incident response.

## üë§ My Role
- **Security Operations Center Analyst**
- Event monitoring and real-time threat detection
- Security incident investigation and analysis  
- Incident response coordination and mitigation
- Documentation and reporting of security events
- Threat intelligence analysis and correlation

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Technologies Used
- **SIEM Platforms:** Splunk, IBM QRadar, AlienVault OSSIM
- **Network Security:** Wireshark, Nmap, Tcpdump
- **Endpoint Security:** CrowdStrike, Carbon Black, YARA
- **Log Analysis:** ELK Stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana)
- **Scripting & Automation:** Python, PowerShell, Bash
- **Incident Management:** ServiceNow, Jira Service Management
- **Threat Intelligence:** MISP, VirusTotal, Hybrid Analysis

## üéØ Key Project Components

### 1. Real-Time Security Monitoring
- Configured SIEM dashboards for continuous monitoring
- Implemented custom correlation rules for threat detection
- Established baseline metrics for normal network behavior

### 2. Incident Response Procedures
- Developed standardized incident response playbooks
- Created automated alert triage workflows
- Implemented evidence preservation protocols

### 3. Threat Analysis & Investigation
- Conducted malware analysis using sandbox environments
- Performed network forensics on suspicious traffic
- Analyzed attack vectors and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs)

### 4. Security Automation
- Built Python scripts for automated log parsing
- Created PowerShell modules for Windows event analysis
- Developed custom SIEM queries for threat hunting

## üìä Achievements & Results
- **Threat Detection:** Successfully identified and mitigated 15+ security incidents including malware infections, unauthorized access attempts, and data exfiltration attempts
- **Response Time:** Reduced average incident response time from 45 minutes to 12 minutes through automation
- **False Positive Reduction:** Decreased false positive alerts by 60% through rule optimization
- **Documentation:** Produced comprehensive incident reports and post-incident reviews used for team training

## üèÜ Key Skills Demonstrated
- **Technical Analysis:** Log analysis, network forensics, malware reverse engineering
- **Risk Assessment:** Vulnerability assessment and threat prioritization
- **Communication:** Clear incident reporting and stakeholder communication
- **Automation:** Security tool integration and workflow automation
- **Compliance:** Understanding of security frameworks (NIST, ISO 27001)

## üìö Lessons Learned
- **Rapid Triage Importance:** Quick and accurate initial assessment is crucial for effective incident response
- **Automation Benefits:** Strategic automation significantly improves response efficiency without losing analysis quality
- **Team Communication:** Clear, concise communication during incidents prevents confusion and speeds resolution
- **Continuous Learning:** Threat landscape evolves rapidly, requiring ongoing skill development and tool adaptation

## üîÆ Future Enhancements
- Implement machine learning models for advanced threat detection
- Develop automated forensic analysis capabilities
- Integrate threat intelligence feeds for proactive hunting
- Create cross-platform incident response automation
